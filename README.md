![Generating explanations for the flashcards using AI locally](./assets/generating-explanations-using-AI-Locally.gif)

Collect flashcards from your Kindle and generate AI-powered explanations for Anki. This project is a fork of the original [Fluentcards](https://github.com/katspaugh/fluentcards) by [katspaugh](https://github.com/katspaugh). A huge thank you to the original project for providing a solid foundation for this AI-enhanced version!

## How It Works

The Vocabulary Builder on Kindle devices is a powerful feature for language learners. It collects all the words you look up, including their definition and context. This project takes your Kindle vocabulary and uses an AI language model (LLM) hosted by Ollama to generate detailed explanations based on the word and its context. These explanations are then ready to be imported into Anki for spaced repetition learning.

### Key Features

- üìö Collect vocabulary from your Kindle device.
- üß† Generate AI-powered explanations for each word based on its context.
- üìù Export the vocabulary and explanations in a format ready for Anki.
- üîß Runs locally to ensure privacy and security.

### How to Use

1. **Collecting Words on Your Vocabulary List:**
   - Ensure your Kindle device is set up with the correct dictionary for the language you're learning.
   - Look up words while reading on your Kindle to add them to your vocabulary list.

2. **Exporting Your Vocabulary File:**
   - Connect your Kindle to your computer and locate the `vocab.db` file.
   - Copy the `vocab.db` file to your computer.

3. **Installing and Running Ollama Locally:**
   - Download and install Ollama from [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download).
   - Run Ollama locally on the default port (http://localhost:11434):
        ```
        ollama serve
        ```
   - If you want a version that doesn't require the ollama, please check the tag [backend-orca-ai-with-no-ollama](https://github.com/gustavostz/fluentcards-ai/tree/backend-orca-ai-with-no-ollama)

4. **Running the Frontend:**
   - Ensure you have Node.js (version 14) and npm or Yarn installed.
   - Install the dependencies and start the React app.
   - Upload your `vocab.db` file and click on fetch AI-generated explanations.

5. **Exporting for Anki:**
   - Once the explanations are fetched, you can export the deck in Anki format.
   - Import the deck into Anki, ensuring that "Allow HTML in fields" is ticked.

### Installation and Setup

#### Frontend (React):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
# or
yarn install
yarn start
```

#### Change AI model (optional)

Currently, the project is configured to use the llama model. If you want to use a different model, you can change the model in the `\frontend\src\vocab\components\Words\Words.jsx` file.

```model: "llama3"```

### Credits

This project is a fork of [Fluentcards](https://github.com/katspaugh/fluentcards) by [katspaugh](https://github.com/katspaugh). The AI integration and modifications to the original project were made to enhance the learning experience by providing more contextually relevant explanations.
